PhoenixCraft
============
- When you are updating the PhoenixCraftModpack, be sure to note ALL your changes in the changelog file above the README file
- The PhoenixCraftModpack folder will be the official folder that I will zip-up and use to submit/update the modpack with FTB.
- Anything that needs to be on this github, but is not in the PCM folder, must be put in this folder, because I must follow certain indexing rules!


How-to Install

1. Install MinecraftForge on your VANILLA launcher (Use the forge version specified in "info.txt" file, located in the "PhoenixCraftModpack" folder)
2. Clone PhoenixCraft onto your desktop (Using the GitHub application is preferred, as you can update with 1 hit on a button)
3. Create a new instance (using specified forge version, on vanilla launcher) using C:\-Wherever\PhoenixCraft\PhoenixCraftModpack\minecraft as root directory
4. Set permgen to 256mb using "-XX:MaxPermSize=256m" (without quotes)
5. Launch!
